  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Advanced_03_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Following the Composite Pattern directly, create a system
  // of classes that represent composed text elements.
  // - A Paragraph class has a String and a print method.
  // - A Document is composed of zero or more Paragraphs or Documents.
  // - A Document has an add, remove, and a print method.

  // TODO 2: Create a main method that demonstrates how your Composite
  // Pattern works. Create at a Document that has at least two levels
  // of nesting within it.
