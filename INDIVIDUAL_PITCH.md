# Individual Pitch


### Yeju Jung (Audio, Barrier, BarrierManager, and GameRestart class)
As the developer in charge of the Audio, Barrier, BarrierManager, and GameRestart classes, my responsibilities include managing the barriers that protect the player's spaceship from the aliens' bullets, creating and managing the barriers in the game, including positioning, destruction, and regeneration. Also write a class that implements sound effect of the game and also restart button after play dies.

### Bingdi Zhou (Invader, InvaderManager, Sprite, DatabaseHandler, and GameStateManager class)
As a developer of the Invader class and Invader Manager class, I will implement the Invader class which will represent individual invaders in the game and the InvaderManager class which will manage the collection of invaders and provide methods for adding, removing, and updating their properties. I have implemented a MongoDB inside our game to be able to track the gamestatus and the leaderboard.

### Tae Hyung Lee (Player, Keyboard, PlayerTest, InvaderTest, BarrierTest class)
As the designated as Player, Keyboard, PlayerTest, InvaderTest, BarrierTest class for the Java project, I will create an engaging and visually appealing representation of the player while ensuring that the game mechanics are functioning smoothly through rigorous testing and debugging. By utilizing my expertise in both art and programming, I aim to deliver a seamless gaming experience for all players to be able to control the spaceship using keyboard. Lastly, I have wrote test classes for Player, Invader, and Barrier(Three main classes) to check if they are funtioning properly.

### All 4 team-members tasks (Windows, Stopwatch)
Our game requires objects that can be shot, moved, and collided with, so we propose implementing three Java interfaces: Shootable, Movable, and Collidable.
The Shootable interface will represent objects that can be shot, the Movable interface will represent objects that can move, and the Collidable interface will represent objects that can collide with other objects.
Implementing these interfaces will allow for more modular and reusable code in our game, and make it easier to add new objects with these behaviors.
