  // Advanced Question 01 (20 points, 3 TODOs)
  // Idea: tests your ability to create and use Singletons.

  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Advanced_01_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Create a new class called Advanced_01_Server. Make it a Singleton.
  // It should have two fields:
  // - uid: a random integer generated on construction
  // - connected: a boolean set to false on construction

  // TODO 2: Create a new test class and write the test cases needed to
  // ensure that this Singleton is working as expected. You will be marked
  // on the quality and coverage of your test cases.
