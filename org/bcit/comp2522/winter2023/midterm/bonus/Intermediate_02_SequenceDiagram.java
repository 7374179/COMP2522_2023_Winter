  // Intermediate Question 02 (10 points, 2 TODOs)
  // Idea: tests your ability to use a UML Sequence diagram.

  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Intermediate_02_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Read the class diagram from /img/sequence.diagram.png
  // Follow it exactly and recreate the diagram in code using separate
  // classes prefixed with Intermediate_02_.

  // NOTE: It will be easiest to complete this question BEFORE
  // the Intermediate_03 question and AFTER the Intermediate_01 question.
  // In fact, you should basically be able to copy-paste the Intermediate_01
  // classes and just fill in the internal calling system. However, if you
  //  are feeling confused, feel free to read the other class diagrams
  //  to help you get a sense of the code.
