  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Basic_06_myClass. Name them something useful,
  // other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Write the full set of tests needed for the "lock" and "unlock"
  // methods of Basic_05_Door. Remember that our rule is at LEAST one test per condition.
  // Full marks for correctly using different fixtures.
