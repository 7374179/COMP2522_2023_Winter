# Midterm-Winter-2023

Welcome to the COMP 2522 midterm!

This midterm is designed to be a "time trial," by which I mean that you are given more questions than you could possibly answer well in the allotted time. Questions are tiered into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. Intermediate and Advanced questions include tests of the same skills that Basic questions test, so it is possible to get full marks answering only Advanced and Intermediate questions without answering any Basic questions. Points per question are estimated, since I will reweight the points allotted per question according to class statistics, e.g., questions that many people have gotten correct may be weighted down vs. questions that few people have gotten correct may be weighted up. Extra marks may be given for good coding practices, i.e., clear comments, good coding practices, readable code, following SOLID principles.

The best strategy is to attempt as many questions as possible in order of Advanced, then Intermediate, then finally to Basic.

## Instructions
The instructions for each question are in the comments. I've given the number of points and TODOs in those comments as well. You are welcome to ask clarifying questions during the exam, but not conceptual questions. If you need to make an assumption, write it in a comment of your own.

I will ONLY mark questions that are in the `org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers` package. I will also not be able to guess which classes are supposed to belong to each question unless you prefix with the label and number of the question you are attempting. So, I will ignore any classes that do not have a prefix. This will all be done automatically via a command-line function, so do be precise.

## Materials
You are required to bring your own computer. Make sure it is CHARGED since there is no guarantee of enough power outlets in the room.

You should bring a pen for writing answers to diagram questions. Paper will be provided.

You are allowed any number of written materials or physical items that are not internet-capable or able to run arbitrary code. So, e.g., calculators and geometry sets are allowed, but no smart phones or watches. Tablets that are displaying your notes are fine.

## References and Plagiarism
You will be allowed to access the following websites during the midterm. These are to be READ only. You MAY NOT COPY FROM THESE WEBSITES but only use them as a reference. My rule is that you must RE-TYPE the code WITHOUT DIRECTLY LOOKING AT IT. It may sound foolish, but that's the rule I'll be applying and which allows me to catch legitimate plagairism.
- Any note-taking service that is ONLY used for accessing notes, i.e., OneDrive, Notion, etc.
- https://docs.oracle.com/
- https://devdocs.io/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
- https://refactoring.guru/

And ONLY the GitHub page for the midterm. CONTRARY TO LAST TERM'S MIDTERM, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER ONLINE RESOURCES, EVEN IF THEY ARE ACCESSED THROUGH YOUR IDE. E.g., GitHub copilot is NOT allowed. You ARE allowed as many downloaded resources you would like, or paper copies of resources as you would like.

Now, you may ask, how will he know? The answer is that I will gauge by running a number of NLP checks against your code. If there is similar code between students, I will flag it for a deeper plagairism check. What this means is that you should very probably not be using anything covert to generate code. Now, I'll be reasonable about it, e.g., the automatic getters and setters won't be something that I expect to be different between people, but there are extremely obvious indicators of similar code that I have been able to detect so far when reading it myself. So, the process will be: (1) I run all files against each other for similarities and flag anything that has a similarity score above a threshold that I set; (2) I read each instance of similarity; and (3) if I determine that you used the same source, I will start a plagairism investigation process.

This is more for the students who are not going to attempt to cheat: trust me, it's exceedingly obvious when people have been copying off of the same source code. The reason why I have the RE-TYPE WITHOUT LOOKING clause is because that makes my job easy. Nobody is capable of retyping perfectly from the same source by even short-term memory if they're not looking at it. So, even if you studied together and have similar references, you will not have similar code if you re-type. It's actually harder to make copy-pasted code look like non-similar code than people realize.
