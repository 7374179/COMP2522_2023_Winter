  // Intermediate Question 02 (10 points, 3 TODOs)
  // Idea: tests your ability to use a UML Sequence diagram.

  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Intermediate_02_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Read the class diagram from /img/communication.diagram.png
  // Follow it exactly and recreate the diagram in code using separate
  // classes prefixed with Intermediate_02_.
  //
  // Write a main function in the appropriate place that demonstrates
  // the communication as indicated by the diagram.

  // NOTE: It will be easiest to complete this question AFTER
  // the Intermediate_01 and Intermediate_02 questions.
  // In fact, you should basically be able to copy-paste all of your
  // Intermediate_02 code and be nearly done. However, it is technically
  // possible to complete this question independent of the others.
