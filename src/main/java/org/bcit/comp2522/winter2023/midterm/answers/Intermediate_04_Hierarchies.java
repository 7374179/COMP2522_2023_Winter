  // Intermediate Question 04 (10 points, 2 TODOs)
  // Idea: tests your ability to model real-world phenomena using classes.

  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from this package:
  //   org.bcit.comp2522.winter2023.midterm.answers
  //
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Intermediate_04_myClass. Name them something
  // useful, other than "myClass", that is just an example.

  // TODO 1: Create a system of classes in code that models the relationships between
  // different types of Animals, specifically:
  // - BlueWhale, Dog, Bear
  // - Trout, Shark
  // - Tree, VenusFlyTrap
  //
  // Create superclasses to model these relations (at least 4).
  // Also create interfaces to model abilities (at least 3).
  // Marks given for clarity, readability, and correctness.
