  // TODO 1: Implement an equals method that checks each the class
  // attribute x against the incoming object. Equality should be only
  // between classes that are the same.

  // TODO 2: Make this class implement Comparable. Implement all of the
  // methods that the interface demands. Compare along the x dimension.
  // Ensure that equality in the equals method is the same as in compareTo.

  // TODO 3: Create a main method that demonstrates EACH of the Comparable
  // conditions, including the exceptions.
