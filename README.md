Welcome to COMP 2522! This is your first Daily Assignment. The "daily" assignments are short coding problems given once per lecture. You only need to make the tests that I give you pass. Daily Assignments are due in one week. Usually I will give the answer (or a strong hint) during the lecture.

You should make sure the [tests pass in your IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-tests-in-gradle.html#run_gradle_test), but you can also use GitHub classroom's autograder. For most assignments, if the tests pass, you pass the assignment. There are no part marks. 

The last thing to be aware of is that I use this for attendance checking and grading. So, you must be physically in-class and open it in-class **within the first 5 minutes of class** to get full grades. To be clear, **you do not need to make the tests pass in the first five minutes**, you just need to create the repo by accepting the assignment. Note that sharing the link or opening the link outside of class is not allowed.
