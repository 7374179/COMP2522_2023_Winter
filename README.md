# Lab 06
Today's lab is your chance to get help on midterm concepts. If you haven't had a chance yet, review [last term's Midterm](https://github.com/COMP2522/Midterm-Fall-2022) and [last term's Midterm notes](https://github.com/COMP2522/Midterm-notes-Fall-2022).

## TODO 1: Prepare your workspace
Take time now to ensure that your IDE workspace is running optimally. If you are encountering recurring bugs, talk to Paul about them now. Ensure that you can do the following:
- Create a new project in gradle from existing sources as well as from version control
- Add files, directories, and modules to the project
- Use git commands such as add, commit, merge, push, and pull
- Make sure you have no errors with the JDKs
- Create tests, mark directories as test root, mark directories as excluded from the build

## TODO 2: Use the `Basic` questions as a test for your approach
For this TODO, you will practice the midterm format. You should do this on your own to simulate the midterm environment. Do the following:
- Set a timer for 50 minutes. Start it immediately.
- Navigate to the page for [last term's Midterm](https://github.com/COMP2522/Midterm-Fall-2022)
- Clone the repository
- Complete each question in the `Basic` category. 
- Take notes on what you don't understand or can't complete within 50 minutes. If you can complete everything, move on to `Intermediate` and `Advanced` questions (although some content will be different).

## TODO 3: Review your notes
Review your notes on each thing you can't understand or complete. For each, write a diagnosis of your problem and a potential solution. Put that here, in this README. If you don't know, brainstorm with your labmates and Paul.

## TODO 4: Create your "cheatsheets" and other materials that you will bring to the midterm.
You will be allowed to access the following websites during the midterm. These are to be READ only. You MAY NOT COPY FROM THESE WEBSITES but only use them as a reference. My rule is that you must RE-TYPE the code WITHOUT DIRECTLY LOOKING AT IT. It may sound foolish, but that's the rule I'll be applying and which allows me to catch legitimate plagairism.
- https://docs.oracle.com/
- https://devdocs.io/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
- https://refactoring.guru/

And ONLY the GitHub page for the midterm. CONTRARY TO LAST TERM'S MIDTERM, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER ONLINE RESOURCES, EVEN IF THEY ARE ACCESSED THROUGH YOUR IDE. E.g., GitHub copilot is NOT allowed. You ARE allowed as many downloaded resources you would like, or paper copies of resources as you would like.

Now, you may ask, how will he know? The answer is that I will gauge by running a number of NLP checks against your code. If there is similar code between students, I will flag it for a deeper plagairism check. What this means is that you should very probably not be using anything covert to generate code. Now, I'll be reasonable about it, e.g., the automatic getters and setters won't be something that I expect to be different between people, but there are extremely obvious indicators of similar code that I have been able to detect so far when reading it myself. So, the process will be: (1) I run all files against each other for similarities and flag anything that has a similarity score above a threshold that I set; (2) I read each instance of similarity; and (3) if I determine that you used the same source, I will start a plagairism investigation process.

This is more for the students who are not going to attempt to cheat: trust me, it's exceedingly obvious when people have been copying off of the same source code. The reason why I have the RE-TYPE WITHOUT LOOKING clause is because that makes my job easy. Nobody is capable of retyping perfectly from the same source by even short-term memory if they're not looking at it. So, even if you studied together and have similar references, you will not have similar code if you re-type. It's actually harder to make copy-pasted code look like non-similar code than people realize.
