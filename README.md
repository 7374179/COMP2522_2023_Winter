# LL-02

Today's lecture code will look similar to the lab code, with a few important differences:
1) Added the Box class which draws a rectangle on screen
2) Added my own version of Collidable (may not be the same as yours!) to work with Box
3) A few tests to solve

For now, just solve the first test, `testBallDNEBox`. Then, once the lecture is done, all other tests should pass (including the one that is currently commented out).

Keep this code ready, since we'll be referring to it and using it extensively.
