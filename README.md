# SL-13

We'll be reading and completing this code during class. For now, just read through and solve any TODOs that you feel are easy. Write all of the UML diagrams for yourself to get a sense of the code.
1. Class diagram to see what the overall methods should be and relations to other Java classes/interfaces.
2. Communication diagram to see what will talk to what.
3. Sequence diagram to see what order communication will be in.

No tests to pass today.
